## Budgeting Basics

### The 50/30/20 Rule

The 50/30/20 budgeting rule is a simple framework for allocating your after-tax income:

- **50% for Needs**: Essential expenses like housing, utilities, groceries, transportation, insurance, and minimum debt payments
- **30% for Wants**: Discretionary spending like dining out, entertainment, hobbies, and vacations
- **20% for Savings**: Emergency fund, retirement savings, debt repayment beyond minimums, and investments

**Example**: If you earn $4,000 per month after taxes:
- $2,000 for needs
- $1,200 for wants
- $800 for savings

### Emergency Fund

An emergency fund is a savings buffer for unexpected expenses like medical bills, car repairs, or job loss.

**Recommendations**:
- Start with $1,000 as a mini emergency fund
- Build up to 3-6 months of essential expenses
- Keep it in a high-yield savings account for easy access
- Only use for true emergencies, not planned expenses

## Investing Fundamentals

### Types of Investment Accounts

**401(k) / 403(b)**: Employer-sponsored retirement accounts
- Contributions reduce taxable income
- Often include employer matching (free money!)
- Contribution limit: $23,000 (2024)
- Early withdrawal penalty before age 59½

**IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
- Traditional IRA: Tax-deductible contributions, taxed on withdrawal
- Roth IRA: After-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals in retirement
- Contribution limit: $7,000 (2024)
- Income limits apply for Roth IRA

**Taxable Brokerage Account**:
- No contribution limits
- No tax advantages, but maximum flexibility
- Pay capital gains tax on profits
- Good for goals before retirement

### Asset Allocation

Asset allocation is how you divide your investments across different categories:

**Stocks (Equities)**:
- Higher risk, higher potential return
- Good for long-term growth (10+ years)
- More volatile in short term

**Bonds (Fixed Income)**:
- Lower risk, lower return
- Provides stability and income
- Less volatile than stocks

**Sample Age-Based Allocation**:
- Age 20-30: 90% stocks, 10% bonds
- Age 30-40: 80% stocks, 20% bonds
- Age 40-50: 70% stocks, 30% bonds
- Age 50-60: 60% stocks, 40% bonds
- Age 60+: 50% stocks, 50% bonds

*Note: This is a general guideline. Your ideal allocation depends on risk tolerance and goals.*

### Index Funds vs Individual Stocks

**Index Funds**:
- Track a market index (e.g., S&P 500)
- Automatic diversification
- Low fees
- Recommended for most investors
- Examples: VTI, VOO, VTSAX

**Individual Stocks**:
- Higher risk due to concentration
- Requires research and monitoring
- Can outperform or underperform market
- Better as small portion of portfolio (<10%)

## Debt Management

### Good Debt vs Bad Debt

**Good Debt** (potentially):
- Mortgage: Builds equity, tax deductible interest
- Student loans: Invests in earning potential
- Low-interest debt used for appreciating assets

**Bad Debt**:
- High-interest credit card debt (15-25% APR)
- Payday loans (400%+ APR)
- Debt for depreciating assets (cars, consumer goods)

### Debt Payoff Strategies

**Avalanche Method** (mathematically optimal):
1. Pay minimums on all debts
2. Put extra money toward highest interest rate debt
3. Once paid off, roll payment to next highest rate
4. Saves most money on interest

**Snowball Method** (psychological wins):
1. Pay minimums on all debts
2. Put extra money toward smallest balance
3. Once paid off, roll payment to next smallest
4. Builds motivation through quick wins

## Retirement Planning

### How Much to Save

**General Rules**:
- Start with at least 15% of gross income
- Includes employer match
- Increase by 1% annually

**Retirement Savings Calculation**:
- Need 25x annual expenses for retirement
- Example: $50,000/year expenses = $1.25 million needed
- Based on 4% safe withdrawal rate

### Retirement Account Priority

1. **401(k) up to employer match**: Free money, take it!
2. **High-interest debt payoff**: Rates over 7% should be eliminated
3. **Max out Roth IRA**: $7,000/year (2024)
4. **Max out 401(k)**: $23,000/year (2024)
5. **HSA** (if eligible): $4,150 individual, $8,300 family (2024)
6. **Taxable brokerage account**: For additional savings

### Tax-Loss Harvesting
